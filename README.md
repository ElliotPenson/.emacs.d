# .emacs.d

## Installation

Fork and then clone this repository, putting the .emacs.d folder in your foot
directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElliotPenson/.emacs.d.git
```

By default, emacs will look for the .emacs configuration file in your root
directory. Use a symlink to make a .emacs alias which will point to the actual
config file in .emacs.d:

```
ln -s ~/.emacs.d/emacs ~/.emacs
```
